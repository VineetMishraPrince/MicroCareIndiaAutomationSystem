# MicroCare Customer Service

**Legacy Visual Basic 6.0 Desktop Application**  
This project is a customer care and service center management system originally developed for **MicroCare India** as a final year BCA project.

---

This project is a legacy desktop application originally developed in **Visual Basic 6 (VB6)** for **MicroCare India**. It served as an internal system to manage customer support and service center operations, including complaint registration, photo capture, customer record maintenance, and service status updates.

This repository is a preservation of the original VB6 codebase, which may be used for future migration to modern technologies like **VB.NET** or **C# WinForms**.

### 🧩 Key Modules:
- Customer registration and service intake
- Complaint tracking and history
- Photo attachment and preview
- Simple admin workflow
- MS Access-based local database integration

**Note:** VB6 is now a legacy technology and is no longer supported by Microsoft. This code is maintained for reference and educational purposes, especially for legacy migration scenarios.
